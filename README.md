# Efficient Go gin <img width="22px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gin-gonic/logo/master/color.png"> and :unicorn: Fx template template

An organized template for Go to:
- build a well-structure repository
- save time for building everything from scratch to focus more on business logics

## Why?
- Go gin is simple, has a fast performance and highly-detailed error
- Fx dependency helps dismiss the need for global state, so fast to register dependencies.
